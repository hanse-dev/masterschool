# Nested Loops
1. Use nested loops to print a 5x5 grid of asterisks.
2. Create nested loops to print a multiplication table from 1 to 10.
3. Write nested loops to find all pairs of numbers in two lists.
4. Develop nested loops to create a pyramid pattern of numbers.
5. Use nested loops to transpose a 2D list (matrix).
6. Use nested loops to flatten a 2D list into a 1D list.
7. Create nested loops to find the sum of each row and column in a 2D list.
