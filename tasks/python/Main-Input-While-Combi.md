# Understand and use if name == ‘main’, inputs and while loops
## Task: Guess the Number Game 
### Goal
 Create a number guessing game that runs only when the script is executed directly. 
### Scope
 Generate a random number, allow multiple guesses, and provide feedback. 
### Requirements:
- Use if name == ‘main’ to encapsulate the game logic
- Use input() to get user guesses
- Implement a while loop for multiple guesses
- Provide “too high” or “too low” feedback after each guess
## Task: Calculator Module 
### Goal
 Develop a calculator module that can be imported or run as a standalone program. 
### Scope
 Implement basic arithmetic operations and a command-line interface. 
### Requirements:

- Define functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Use if name == ‘main’ to provide a CLI when run directly
- Use input() to get operation choice and numbers from the user
- Implement a while loop to allow multiple calculations
## Task: File Word Counter 
### Goal
 Create a program that counts words in a file, with the option to run interactively. 
### Scope
 Read a file, count words, and display results. When run directly, allow user input for the filename. 
### Requirements:

- Define a function to count words in a given file
- Use if name == ‘main’ to provide an interactive mode
- Use input() to get the filename from the user when in interactive mode
- Implement a while loop to allow counting words in multiple files
## Task: Quiz Game 
### Goal
 Develop a quiz game that can be imported as a module or run as a standalone program. 
### Scope
 Create a set of questions and answers, keep score, and provide feedback. 
### Requirements:

- Define a function to run a single quiz round
- Use if name == ‘main’ to start the game when run directly
- Use input() to get user answers
- Implement a while loop to allow multiple quiz rounds
## Task: Temperature Converter 
### Goal
 Create a temperature converter that can be used as a module or run interactively. 
### Scope
 Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, allow multiple conversions in interactive mode. 
### Requirements:

- Define functions for Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius conversions
- Use if name == ‘main’ to provide an interactive mode
- Use input() to get temperature values and conversion direction from the user
- Implement a while loop in interactive mode to allow multiple conversions
